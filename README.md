# Game-of-Life-in-C<br>
"Game of Life" is a simulation of the cellular automaton devised by John Conway in 1970. This repository contains an implementation of the game in C, including a graphical interface to visualize the evolution of cells based on their neighboring cells' states. <br>
• Utilized linked lists data structure to represent the game cells.<br>
• Developed an algorithm that simulates the game mechanics, including cell birth, death, and evolution. <br>• Optimized the simulation algorithm for speed and accuracy, achieving linear time complexity.
